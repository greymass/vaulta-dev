## Overview

This document describes Stage 1 of the transition process for the Vaulta Network. The Vaulta Foundation is shutting down. This proposal creates two new entities to ensure continuity of critical staff and assets.

The two new entities are:
- **Vaulta Development Team (VDT)**: A for-profit corporation for software development
- **Vaulta Network Trust (VNT)**: A non-profit organization for asset custody

This is only the first stage. More changes will be required for the Vaulta Network to succeed.

Off-chain work has begun to start these entities. However, funding is required to begin operations. The on-chain work includes:
- Creating new accounts
- Deploying a new distribution contract
- Configuring the distribution system

This proposal also addresses two Foundation accounts that are now inaccessible.

Network consensus on this proposal is critical. It signals the network's direction and begins the handoff from the Vaulta Foundation to the new entities.

### Understanding Network Ownership

This document uses the phrase "owned by the network". This means no single person controls the account or makes the decision.

Block Producers control these accounts through voting. **15 out of 21 Block Producers must agree** before any action happens.

This control happens through the `eosio@active` or `eosio.prods@active` permission. Block Producers use this control to:
- Manage account permissions
- Change distribution configurations
- Make decisions about network funds
- Approve changes through network consensus

This system keeps critical accounts and funds under community control.

## Vaulta Development Team (VDT)

The Vaulta Development Team (VDT) will be an independent organization. It will develop and maintain the open source software for the Vaulta Network. The VDT leadership will coordinate with Block Producers to ensure alignment and transparency.

The Vaulta Network will fund the VDT through existing mechanisms. These are the same mechanisms previously used by the Vaulta Foundation.

### Funding Flow

A new intermediate step will be added to the existing [eosio.saving](#eosiosaving-config) process:

1. Funds flow to [dist.vaulta](#distvaulta) account
2. 50% flows to [dev.vaulta](#devvaulta) account for VDT access
3. 50% flows to [fund.vaulta](#fundvaulta) account (unallocated)

The [dev.vaulta](#devvaulta) account is [owned by the network](#understanding-network-ownership). The development team can access it when required. Only then do funds leave network control and go to the development team.

**Why use two distribution contracts?** The dist.vaulta contract sits between eosio.saving and dev.vaulta. This provides flexibility. [Block Producers](#understanding-network-ownership) can change development funding without touching the core eosio.saving contract. This protects core network systems.

### Legal Structure

The VDT will be a for-profit U.S. corporation. This reduces operational complexity. The VDT will prioritize contributions to open source projects owned by the Vaulta Network Trust.

Code ownership is organized this way to prevent future organizational changes from impacting developer contributions.

### VDT Leadership

Areg will lead the core development team through this new entity. The team composition is still being finalized. It is expected to have around 5 members initially.

This proposal delegates development team management to Areg and the team he chooses.

### VDT Distribution

The VDT will receive 50% of the distribution through the [dev.vaulta](#devvaulta) account from the [dist.vaulta](#distvaulta) account.

The remaining 50% will go to the [fund.vaulta](#fundvaulta) account. This account is [owned by the network](#understanding-network-ownership). The network will decide later how to use these funds. Future uses could include more development funding, community programs, or infrastructure projects.

This amount should be enough to fund the core development team and its operations.

### VDT Permissions

The [dev.vaulta](#devvaulta) account permissions are managed by a multisig permission. This multisig is controlled by VDT members with additional backup signers selected by VDT leadership.

The final configuration will be confirmed after participants agree to this role.

**Note**: The dev.vaulta account permission will be updated in the 2nd msig proposal as needed.

### VDT Immediate Priorities

The first goals for this leadership team are already in progress:

- Work with legal, accounting, and other professionals to establish the corporation
- Determine minimal organization structure and hire critical staff and developers
- Perform administrative work to begin operations
- Evaluate the state of the Vaulta Network to decide the technology roadmap

Communication and collaboration with willing Block Producers and leaders of other Vaulta-based organizations is required throughout this process.

## Vaulta Network Trust (VNT)

The Vaulta Network Trust (VNT) will be a new independent non-profit organization. It will provide permanent operational functions for the network. It will hold off-chain shared assets.

The Vaulta Network cannot be a legal owner because it is not a legal entity. The VNT will own assets on behalf of the network.

The VNT mission is to ensure continuity of these assets as different organizations rise and fall over time. The VNT must remain minimal in size. It must remain without influence despite controlling these assets.

### VNT Transition Team

This msig proposal delegates responsibility to select people. They will form a transition team. The transition team will research and bootstrap this entity on behalf of the network.

The group will work to achieve a sensible structure in terms of cost and governance. The transition team will be disbanded after the VNT is created and an initial board of directors is in place.

**Note**: The transition team will be defined before Proposal 2. This document v6 is ready for Proposal 1. A future version will add transition team details before Proposal 2.

### VNT Transition Team: Immediate Priorities

Network leadership will identify individuals or entities capable of leading the creation of this entity. This will include:

- Research the best region to incorporate and legal structure
- Identify a sufficient number of board members and recruit them to the future VNT board
- Present the network leadership with a researched plan for approval using a symbolic msig
- Create the legal entity and coordinate the transfer of assets from the Foundation
- Reach consensus with [Block Producers](#understanding-network-ownership) on the members of the first Board of Directors

### VNT Scope

Once established, the VNT will be the custodian of the following for the Vaulta Network:

- The remaining off-chain financial assets held specifically by the Vaulta Foundation
- The Vaulta brand and intellectual property related to the Vaulta Network
- Ownership of required services for operations (Github, Google Workspace, Domains, etc)

The VNT Transition Team will work with the Vaulta Foundation as it shuts down. This ensures a smooth transition. The transition timeline is not yet determined.

**Note**: This organization is NOT responsible for network activities like marketing or communications. This organization is exclusively responsible for off-chain asset management.

### VNT Board of Directors

The organization will be managed by a group of known individuals. These individuals must have a vested interest in securing the network and its assets.

The initial VNT leadership will depend on the structure of the entity. The transition team will determine this.

Ideal candidates for potential board members include:

- Representatives of network-funded organizations
- Block Producers

The board can be changed at any time through [network consensus](#understanding-network-ownership). The transition team will explore enforcement options. This may be through the organization's bylaws or through board member agreements. If possible, this will be implemented.

### VNT Funding

This organization needs the smallest budget possible. The VNT focuses only on legal compliance and asset custody.

Initial funding comes from leftover Foundation assets during the handoff.

The transition team will calculate specific budget needs. This includes incorporation costs, legal compliance, basic administration, and asset management. The VNT should budget for 5-10 years of operations. Any extra funds should be reported to [Block Producers](#understanding-network-ownership) for a decision.

## Comparing VDT and VNT

Now that both organizations are described, here is a comparison of their key differences:

| Aspect | VDT (Development Team) | VNT (Network Trust) |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **Type** | For-profit corporation | Non-profit organization |
| **Purpose** | Build and maintain software | Hold shared assets for the network |
| **Size** | Full team (developers, staff) | Minimal (small board only) |
| **Funding** | Claims from dev.vaulta account | Foundation assets during handoff |
| **Control** | Delegated to Areg and VDT leadership | Board directed by network consensus |

Both organizations are independent. Both serve the Vaulta Network but in different ways.

## MSIG Stages

Two msig proposals must be approved in sequential order to reconfigure the network for this proposal.

Additional technical information for each proposal is available using the Github links.

## Proposal 1: Account Creation

The first proposal creates the 2 accounts required for this proposal. This must happen before deploying the smart contract and setting the distribution configuration.

**Technical Documentation**: [../proposals/dev.accounts/](../proposals/dev.accounts/)

**Proposal**

- Status: https://unicove.com/en/vaulta/msig/aaron/fwmpntxlmfhz
- Actions: https://unicove.com/en/vaulta/msig/aaron/fwmpntxlmfhz/actions
- Transaction: https://unicove.com/en/vaulta/msig/aaron/fwmpntxlmfhz/transaction

**Source Code + Documentation**

- https://github.com/greymass/msigs/tree/dev/proposals/dev.accounts

### New Account Details

The following new accounts will be created.

#### dev.vaulta

This account is similar to eosio.grants previously used by the Vaulta Foundation. This account is [owned by the network](#understanding-network-ownership). The Block Producers have granted access to it for the [Vaulta Development Team](#vaulta-development-team-vdt). It will be used to claim and access funding through the [dist.vaulta](#distvaulta) distribution contract.

**Permissions**:
- owner: eosio@active (owned by the network)
- active: Areg + Aaron
  - **Note**: will be replaced in 2nd msig with [VDT Permissions](#vdt-permissions)

#### dist.vaulta

This is a secondary distribution contract [owned by the network](#understanding-network-ownership). The code for this contract is identical to eosio.saving.

**Permissions**:
- owner: eosio@active (owned by the network)
- active: eosio@active (owned by the network)
- devclaim: account-based permission to allow calling upstream eosio.saving::claim action

This contract can claim tokens upstream from the eosio.saving account. Those tokens are then distributed based on this contract's configuration. See [eosio.saving config](#eosiosaving-config) for additional details.

## Proposal 2: Contracts and Configuration

The second proposal configures the distribution contracts and resolves outstanding issues with Vaulta Foundation accounts.

**Technical Documentation**: [../proposals/coredevdist/](../proposals/coredevdist/)

**Proposal**

- Not available yet

**Source Code + Documentation**

- https://github.com/greymass/msigs/tree/dev/proposals/coredevdist

### Messaging

Proposal 2 will include a permanent on-chain reference to this document. This creates a verifiable record that Block Producers approved this specific plan.

The reference is either a document hash or version link. It is stored in a token transfer memo field. This makes the agreement permanent and auditable on the blockchain.

### Distribution Contract

A smart contract will be set on the dist.vaulta account. This contract is identical to the eosio.saving contract. The hash will be identical, but the configuration will be different.

This proposal will call:
- eosio::setcode to set the contract code
- eosio::setabi to set the contract ABI

Once the contract is set, the setdistrib action will be called to distribute funds:
- 50% to dev.vaulta account
- 50% to fund.vaulta account

### New Account Details

The following new account will be created.

#### fund.vaulta

This account receives the 50% unallocated distribution from the dist.vaulta account. The distribution contract requires a receiving account for each allocation. These funds remain under network control for future use.

Block Producers will decide later how to use these funds. Possible uses include additional development funding, community programs, or infrastructure projects.

**Permissions**:
- owner: eosio@active ([owned by the network](#understanding-network-ownership))
- active: eosio@active

### eosio.saving config

The eosio.saving contract configuration must change. The eosio.grants account will be replaced with the dist.vaulta account.

#### Current config

The flow chart below shows how the eosio.saving contract is currently configured.

### Updating permissions

As the Vaulta Foundation shuts down, some existing accounts need permission updates to remain functional.

Two accounts have been identified as unusable based on their permissions. Each account exists in a 2-of-2 multisig between the Foundation and Labs. The Foundation is shutting down. These accounts cannot be used until [Block Producers](#understanding-network-ownership) take action.

Listed below are the actions to remove the Foundation from these permissions. See [technical documentation](../proposals/coredevdist/#updating-permissions) for implementation details.

#### eosio.mware

Links: [Account](https://unicove.com/en/vaulta/account/eosio.mware) | [Permissions](https://unicove.com/en/vaulta/account/eosio.mware/permissions) | [Balances](https://unicove.com/en/vaulta/account/eosio.mware/balances)

This account holds the remaining budget allocated to Middleware. Labs has indicated they would agree with assigning this account to the development team.

Account overview:
- Owner: eosio@active (owned by the network)
- Active: 2-of-2 msig between Foundation and Labs
- 10 million EOS allocated to Middleware, but not released

This proposal would change the active permission to [network ownership](#understanding-network-ownership).

#### fund.wram

Links: [Account](https://unicove.com/en/vaulta/account/fund.wram) | [Permissions](https://unicove.com/en/vaulta/account/fund.wram/permissions) | [Balances](https://unicove.com/en/vaulta/account/fund.wram/balances)

This account was used to accumulate RAM for the network as part of the tokenomics proposal. It currently holds a significant amount of RAM. The RAM cannot be accessed with its current permissions.

Account overview:
- Owner: eosio@active (owned by the network)
- Active: 2-of-2 msig between Foundation and Labs
- Approx 42GB RAM (45,181,397.077 KB) from tokenomics plan

This proposal would change the active permission to [network ownership](#understanding-network-ownership).
