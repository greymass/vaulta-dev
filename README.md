## Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install
```

## Environment Setup

Copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` to set local configuration values.

## Running Proposals

Each proposal can be executed by targetting the directory:

```bash
bun run proposals/<proposal-name>
```

This will create and submit a multisig proposal to Vaulta, which can then be reviewed and approved by the appropriate signers.

## Contributing

When creating new proposals:

1. Create a new directory in `proposals/`
2. Add an `index.ts` file with the proposal logic
3. Create a `README.md` describing the proposal
4. Document all actions, permissions, and security considerations
5. Include contract verification steps if deploying contracts
