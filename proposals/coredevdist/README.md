# Distribution Contract, Configuration, and Foundation Accounts

> Configure distribution contracts and update former Foundation accounts.

## Overview

This proposal seeks to:

1. Unlock a funding mechanism for the core development team
2. Transfers control of fund.wram to the network authority
3. Transfers control of eosio.mware to the network authority

### 1. Development Team Funding

All of the accounts listed below are owned by the network.

- `eosio.saving` retains its current distribution ratios
- `dist.vaulta` receives partial distribution and can redistribute
- `dev.vaulta` claims and allocates to development team accounts

The `dev.vaulta` while being owned by the network is accessible by representatives of the development team. This will start as a 2-of-2 msig permission between Areg and Aaron. Additional signers can be added over time as required.

This configuration can be temporary. At the time of this proposal it is undecided on how this configuration operates long term. This initial configuration is designed to provide a bucket to bootstrap the core development team.

Once the team is established, further review of the configuration can take place.

### 2. The fund.wram account

This is a 2-of-2 msig between the Foundation and Labs in stalemate.

Without a solution on how to use this account, this proposal will simply replace the active permission with `eosio@active`. 

This step is being taken to remove control from the Foundation account, without needing to decide on the fate of the account.

### 3. The eosio.mware account

This is a 2-of-2 msig between the Foundation and Labs in stalemate.

Without a solution on how to use this account, this proposal will simply replace the active permission with `eosio@active`. 

This step is being taken to remove control from the Foundation account, without needing to decide on the fate of the account.

### Allocations

| Sender | Receiver | Allocation (%)| 
|--------|----------|---------------|

### Account Structure

**dev.vaulta** - Development team multi-sig account (2-of-2)
- Owned by the network (eosio@active)
- Accessible with consensus of representatives of development 
    - ahayrapetian@active (Areg)
    - aaron@active (Aaron)

**dist.vaulta** - Distribution contract account
- Owned by the network (eosio@active)
- Runs eosio.saving contract
- Distributes 100% of incoming funds to dev.vaulta

### Build & Verify

This proposal deploys a contract identical to the `eosio.saving` contract on to the `dist.vaulta` account. 

#### Building eosio.saving

The `eosio.saving` account can be built using the CDT from:

https://github.com/VaultaFoundation/eosio.saving

#### Retrieve eosio.saving hash

The contract hash that previously was deployed by BPs can be used to also verify the expected hash.

```bash
# Get hash for the existing contract
curl https://eos.greymass.com/v1/chain/get_code_hash -d '{"account_name":"eosio.saving"}'
```

#### Verify Contract Hash

Verify the WASM file in this project to ensure the hash matches the expected value:

```bash
# Calculate SHA256 hash of the built contract
shasum -a 256 build/contracts/eosio.saving/eosio.saving.wasm
```

**Expected Hash:**
```
fc0dc47848a5d69ccd99fc60f74aa08c68bd734e1f2bc4b4c99191b99b39cffc
``` 

This same hash will be available to review within the proposal.
